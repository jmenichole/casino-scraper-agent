## Data Format

The dashboard expects JSON data in the following format:

[
  {
    "name": "Casino Name",
    "url": "https://example-casino.com",
    "description": "Casino description",
    "licenses": [...],
    "rtp_info": [...],
    "fairness": [...],
    "providers": [...],
    "security": {...},
    "withdrawal_methods": [...],
    "reviews": [...],
    "collection_date": "2024-11-22T00:00:00Z",
    "data_completeness_score": 95.5
  }
]
```

This format is automatically generated when you use the Casino Intelligence Collector CLI:

```bash
